# Exoskeleton Matlab

This package is contributed in  Matlab environment, and it mainly used to verify the algorithm of control and get the forward/inverse kinetic matrix.

## Forward_Kinetic.m

  This code is mainly to calculate the forward kinetic matrix using the algorithm.

## Inverse_Kinetic.m

  This code is mainly to calculate the inverse kinetic matrix using the algorithm. It`s designed by myself specially for the exoskeleton.

## Jaccobi_tool.m

  This code is contributed the Jaccobi matrix which is based on the end effort frame.

## SLX

  There are several simulink file for verifying the matrix or algorithm is right or not.
